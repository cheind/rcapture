This package contains the module RCapture, a collection of intuitive methods to capture method invocations.

RCapture has the following features
- Capturing of instance and class methods of individual objects or entire population of objects.
- Capturing pre or post method invocation.
- Multiple capturings per method.
- Modify method arguments and return values.
- Filter method calls.
- Developed with multithreaded environments in mind.
and many more.

= Simple Example
The example below will capture insertion methods of arrays and output statistics upon 
invocation. For more examples see RCapture module documentation.

 require 'rcapture'
 
 class Array
  include RCapture::Interceptable
 end
 
 Array.capture_post :methods => [:<<, :push] do |cs|
  puts "#{cs.args.first} was inserted to array #{cs.sender}"
 end
 
 [] << 1 << 2
 [].push 3
 
 #=> 1 was inserted to array [1]
 #=> 2 was inserted to array [1, 2]
 #=> 3 was inserted to array [3]
